# nn-basic

This is mostly a recreation of the network found on the website Neural Networks and Deep Learning
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com

This project was done to help teach me more about neural networks, and while the structure and scope of the project is largely identical to the author's, I made sure I completely understood each line of code I was writing.

## Getting Started
There are three big parts of the project (four if you include the data set):

1. **mnist_loader** - to load mnist data

2. **nn** - the neural network implementation and workhorse of the project

3. **main** - brings it together, trains and tests a network on the data

4. **mnistData** - pixel values of images we will be classifying, from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

### Installing

### Example

## Built With
numpy 
* for matrices and matrix algebra operations
matplotlib
* visualizing data and outputing charts on nueral network performance

## Authors
* **Initial framework:** Michael Nielson (https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)
* **Implementation:** Andrew Walker
